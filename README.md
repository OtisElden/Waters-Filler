# Waters-Filler
Extension for auto selecting/filling buttons and options for imagetrend.

This is a project I've been working on intermittenly for a few years now.
Takes some preselected values and automatically chooses them. 

Imagetrend uses a weird process with knockoutJS that causes some traditional methods to fail. You'll see quite a few bypasses/methods to make all of this work.
